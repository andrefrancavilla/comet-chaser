In the Pooling Example Scene, there's a weapon script in which there's a modifiable string called "Projectile Type" that specifies what type of projectile must be extracted
from the pool.
The weapon script component is located in Player>Weapon Anchor within the hierarchy.

If you set the projectile type to "Green Projectile", you will notice that upon clicking, the player will start shooting green projectiles instead of red ones.

Note: As a proof of concept, the 'Green Projectile' object pool within Instant Pool is not set to dynamic, while "Red Projectile" is. This is why you encounter an error 
when you shoot for a long period of time while using 'Green Projectile'. You can either increase the size of the 'Green Projectile' object pool, or set the pool to dynamic.
